# rainy

rainy is a small phone with limited functions. It includes: the current time, a timer, a stopwatch, a music app, a calendar app and a bus app that will give you the bus schedule.

This repositery contains the code for the raspberry pi version of it.
Uses Pillow to create the text that get displayed on a 128x64 OLED display.

I am currently working on a version that will run on the raspberry pi pico W.
